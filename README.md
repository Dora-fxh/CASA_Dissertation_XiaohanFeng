# IMD-shapley
The English Indices of Deprivation 2019 contains 7 domains of deprivation, which are combined using non-linear relationship to create the Index of Multiple Deprivation. 
This research aims to study how these indices contribute to the individual and overall values of IMD. Potential methods include Shapley values and SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations), which stem from game theory and have been used to explain individual predictions in machine learning.
